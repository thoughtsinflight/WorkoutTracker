# WorkoutTracker
    The purpose for this project is to have the user add new work out plans, continue previous work outs and add additional exercises to the work out
## Motivation
    The main motivation behind this project is to use mongo DB and mongoose npm.
### What I Learned
    I learned more about mongo and how to make queries for the user. I also learned more about deploying my app to heroku.
### Conclusion
    I orginally wanted to use handlebars to help me display queries to the DOM but I couldn't get it set up correctly. I tried using other methods but I could not get it to work properly. Its my objective to revist this assignment and get it to function correctly.
